# Coverage of Meteor

*Meteor* is a continuously growing database and depends on the contributions of individual users. 
While there is a small team working on adding new entries and reviewing contributions, there is still much work to be done.
Therefore, this registry does still not have complete coverage of news sources and media organizations in Europe. 
It will take time until we get to a satisfactory number of entries to have a true map of the European media landscape.

Nevertheless, **we encourage all users to contribute entries to *Meteor***. 
Even if it is only a few news sources or your favourite text analysis tool.
If you are not sure where to start, just drop us an email or tweet and we are happy to help.
