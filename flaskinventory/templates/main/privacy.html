        <h1>Informed Consent <small class="text-muted">(for project participation)</small></h1>
        <p class="lead">Thank you for your interest in participating in this crowd coding project! </p>

        <p>
            This data collection effort is part of the <a href="https://www.opted.eu" target="_blank">EU-funded Project OPTED</a>, where researchers work towards the creation of a new European research infrastructure for the study of political communication
            in Europe. For this particular crowd-coding project, we would like to invite you to help us collect information about various European news sources.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose of the project</h2>
        <p>The ultimate goal is an inventory that helps researchers, journalists, and the interested public to extract in-depth knowledge about the European media landscape in a smooth and straightforward manner.</p>
        <p>Aiming at curating and organizing the very rich but also highly fragmented European media landscape in an inventory, we are immensely grateful for your support!</p>
        <h2>Procedures</h2>
        <p>To collect information on European news sources, we have prepared a questionnaire. By filling out the questionnaire you contribute information on individual news sources.</p>
        <p>Before you start, we would like to draw your attention to a few points.</p>
        <h3>Account as requirement to contribute data about news sources:</h3>
        <p>You need to create an account on this platform before you can contribute data to the inventory and before you can fill out the questionnaire.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you choose to create an account on this platform you need to provide an email address. We will store your email address for administrative purposes (i.e., logging in to this platform, administering your account, correspondence strictly
                necessary for operation). We will not share your email address with any third-parties and it is not publicly visible.</li>

            <li>We do not collect sensitive personal information.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to publicly display a username next to the information about news sources that you entered. This username is initially randomly generated and assigned automatically to your account after registration. The username is unrelated
                to the personal information that you provide (i.e. your email address and additional optional information). You may change the username according to your own preferences.</li>

            <li>We reserve the right to store your IP address for administrative and analytical purposes (e.g. preventing SPAM, or creating usage statistics)</li>
            <li>The personal information that you provide (i.e. your email address and additional optional information) will be deleted immediately if you choose to close your account.</li>
            <li>Your participation is anonymous. We will keep all your data strictly confidential.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Once you have an account you can contribute data to the inventory by filling out the questionnaire:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The data that you contribute when filling out the questionnaire does not include personal or sensitive information.</li>
            <li>The data that you contribute when filling out the questionnaire may be made available publicly.</li>
            <li>Before the data is made publicly available, they will be reviewed by an editorial board.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>General:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Data will be collected and processed exclusively on the basis of the legal provisions (&sect; 2f Abs 5 FOG; EU General Data Protection Regulation).</li>

            <li>Servers where data is stored and processed are in the European Union.</li>
        </ul>
